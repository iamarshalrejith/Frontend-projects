How It Works ⚙️

Add Task ➕: You can add a task by typing into the input box and clicking the "Add" button. Each task will appear in the task list.
Mark Task as Complete ✅: Click on a task to toggle it between checked and unchecked states. When checked, the task is crossed out.

Remove Task ❌: Click the "×" button next to any task to delete it from the list.

Persistence 🔒: Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage. When you reload the page, tasks that were added previously will be restored.
